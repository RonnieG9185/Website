<h1>Who Am I</h1>
<h2>I am a 17 year old who goes to college to study IT and have a seasonal job down the seafront by the 
hovercraft I enjoy the work and get good pay and long hours. My favorite part about my job is the money.</h2>
<h3>In my spare time I like to watch Youtube and Netflix and spend time with my mates. I also enjoy
 playing xbox with my mates when its raining and we cant go  out. :)</h3>
